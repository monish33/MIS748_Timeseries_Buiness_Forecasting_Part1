This project aims to provide insights into the Superstore dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the development of regression models. The analysis is divided into two parts: Data Preparation (Part I) and Descriptive Analysis (Part II).

# Part I: Data Preparation

## Data Source
The Superstore data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes information related to sales, profits, and other interesting facts of a large Superstore.

# Data Preparation
In this section, data wrangling and preparation are performed to make the dataset suitable for analysis. Steps include loading the data, summarizing key variables, and creating a new dataset for regression analysis.

## Part II: Descriptive Analysis

Descriptive analysis involves exploring the dataset's main characteristics, patterns, and relationships between variables. It is further divided into Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, and Multivariate Analysis.

# Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis focuses on individual variables. In this project, we analyze Sales for the years 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014.

# Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis examines relationships between pairs of variables. Key relationships explored are between Sales and Orders for each year.

# Multivariate Analysis
Multivariate analysis explores relationships among three or more variables. In this project, multiple regression is used to predict Sales_2017 based on Sales_2016 and Orders_2017.

# Regression Analysis

The final part involves developing and evaluating regression models to predict Sales_2017. Five regression models are developed and evaluated: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
